##Churn Classification Project
Retention of users is very important in companies, websites or telecommunication companies. Involving potential customers in our company,
attracting customers who are considering leaving, or identifying customers that we cannot keep no matter what we do and not investing more will return
us positive in terms of efficiency.For these reasons, churn analysis allows us to take action in advance and improve our marketing and investment techniques
in this direction.
